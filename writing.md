<h4><b>blog posts</b></h4>
<p>I wrote several blog posts while I was in grad school, and I've kept them around for posterity! I don't write much publicly anymore, though I tell myself that could change at any moment.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>{{ post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }} - 
        <a class="post-link-main" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

<h4><b>guest appearances on other blogs</b></h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li>2017-02-02 - <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/ml-optimism">Practicing Machine Learning with Optimism</a><span style="color: #aaa">, part of an InfoQ series on machine learning</span></li>
  <li>2014-04-10 - <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2014/04/10/the-ropensci-hackathon-ropenhack/">The rOpenSci Unconference</a> <span style="color: #aaa">, my reflections on participating in ROpenSci's first hackathon</span></li>
</ul>

<h4><b>published papers</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/17/2778/183245/Polyester-simulating-RNA-seq-datasets-with">Polyester</a>: simulating RNA-seq datasets with differential transcript expression (<i>Bioinformatics</i>, 2015). There's also <a href="https://github.com/leekgroup/polyester_code">code</a> to reproduce results in the paper and <a href="https://github.com/alyssafrazee/polyester">software</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v33/n3/full/nbt.3172.html">Ballgown</a> bridges the gap between transcriptome assembly and expression analysis (<i>Nature Biotechnology</i>, 2015). Again there's <a href="https://github.com/leekgroup/ballgown_code">code</a> to reproduce results in the paper and <a href="https://github.com/alyssafrazee/ballgown">software</a>. The paper itself isn't open-access, but there's a <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/09/05/003665">free preprint</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/3/413">DER Finder</a>, or more formally, "Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data at single-base resolution" (<i>Biostatistics</i>, 2014). There's <a href="https://github.com/leekgroup/derfinder">code</a> that would reproduce the paper several years ago. We also wrote a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/2/e9/2953306/Flexible-expressed-region-analysis-for-RNA-seq">new and improved version</a> of DER Finder in <i>Nucleic Acids Research</i> in 2016.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/449">ReCount</a>: a multi-experiment resource of analysis-ready RNA-seq gene count datasets (<i>BMC Bioinformatics</i>, 2011). An updated version is coming out in 2017 in <i>Nature Biotechnology</i>!</li>
</ul>

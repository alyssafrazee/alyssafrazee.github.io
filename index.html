  <p>Hey, I'm Alyssa! I'm a security engineer at <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> in San Francisco. I've helped build machine learning models for <a href="https://stripe.com/radar">Radar</a>, our product to stop payment fraud, infrastructure to help businesses handle chargebacks, and a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_fraud#Account_takeover">account takeover</a> protections for the Stripe Dashboard, including login and two-factor authentication flows.</p>

  <p>Before joining Stripe, I did a PhD in biostatistics at <a href="http://biostat.jhsph.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a> with <a href="http://jtleek.com/">Jeff Leek</a>. My research focused on computational biology, specifically developing statistical methods and software for finding differential gene expression with RNA sequencing data. A lot of my graduate work is publicly available, including <a href="{{site.url}}/writing">papers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/alyssafrazee">R packages</a>, and <a href="{{site.url}}/talks">talks</a>.</p>

  <p>I spent the summer after my 3rd year of grad school (2013) at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> in New York City and loved it. Before grad school I studied math at <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/">St. Olaf College</a> in Minnesota.</p>

  <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/acfrazee">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssa-frazee-9aa9a095/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/alyssafrazee/">GitHub</a>, or biking, hiking, skiing, <a href="https://rootdivision.org/studio-art-for-adults">painting</a>, or <a href="http://www.leela-sf.com/classes">doing improv</a> around the Bay Area.

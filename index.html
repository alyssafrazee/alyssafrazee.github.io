  <p>Hey, I'm Alyssa! I trained as a statistician and now I'm a software engineer. I like working on problems in either of those fields, and especially on the ones that span both. I'm based in the SF Bay Area and I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://www.checkhq.com/">Check</a>, specializing in fraud prevention and risk.</p>

  <p>Previously, I was a software engineer and technical lead at <a href="https://pilot.com/">Pilot</a>. I spent 2020 building models and software for progressive political campaigns at <a href="https://deck.tools/">Deck</a>, and I was a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> for almost five years, where I built <a href="https://stripe.com/radar">payment fraud models</a> and user security systems (like 2FA and account takeover protection). Before I started working in tech, I did a PhD in biostatistics, spent a glorious summer in New York City at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, and studied math in undergrad. If you want all that in a pdf summary, I have a <a href="resume.pdf">formal resume</a>.</p>

  <p>Outside of work, I have way too many interests, including hiking, biking, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8822839-alyssa-frazee">reading</a>, <a href="https://yetanotherfreakingfoodblog.tumblr.com/">cooking</a>, doing improv, skiing, and learning to garden.</p>
